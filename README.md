# Hello! 👋 I'm Ivan

## 🌟 Who Am I

**Platform Engineer** by day, **AI Agent Architect** by night! With over a **decade of Kubernetes orchestration** under my belt, and a few more decades in **Infrastructure Development** I'm now diving deep into the fascinating world of **Agentic AI systems**. 

I fell in love with Docker orchestration and Kubernetes for its **self-healing, declarative magic** ✨ There's something beautiful about infrastructure that thinks for itself. Now I'm taking that philosophy to the next level by building **AI agents that can actually operate that infrastructure**!

Currently experimenting with cutting-edge **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to revolutionize how we approach SRE and operations. Because why should humans be the bottleneck when AI can help our infrastructure truly heal itself?

## 🚀 What Am I Building

### 🎯 **AIRE A2A + MCP: Autonomous DevOps & SRE**
Building a **Multi-Agent System Architecture** that transforms traditional DevOps workflows:

```
User Input Layer → AI Investigates → Autonomous Fix → PR Created → Root Cause Analysis -> Slack Notification
```

**The Vision**: Infrastructure that doesn't just self-heal, but self-improves through intelligent agent collaboration.

**Tech Stack**: Kagent Framework • Agent Gateway • A2A • MCP • Kubernetes • ArgoCD • LLM Provider

### 🧠 What is **AIRE**
**Artificial Intelligence Reliability Engineering** — a discipline focused on building autonomous, self-healing, and self-improving infrastructure systems using intelligent agents.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

### ☸️ **Kubernetes Ecosystem**
```yaml
experience:
  infrastructure: "20+ years"
  kubernetes: "10+ years"
  ai: "2+ years"
  approach: "Declarative, GitOps-first, Agentic Systems"
  philosophy: "Infrastructure as Code, Everything as Code"
```

### 🤖 **AI & Automation**
- **Kagent Framework** - Cloud-native agentic AI
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** - Multi-agent orchestration
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Standardized tool communication
- **Ollama** - Local LLM deployment and management

### ☁️ **Cloud Platforms**
- **AWS EKS** - Design, configure, manage at scale
- **Azure AKS** - Full-stack cloud-native solutions
- **Multi-cloud** - Because vendor lock-in is so last decade

### 💻 **Languages & Tools**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My daily drivers
python --version  # For serious automation
bash --version    # For quick wins and glue code
kubectl version   # Obviously
```
